# Controls

## Linux desktop (current)

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| Left click or first movement-key press | Capture the mouse for first-person look |
| Mouse | Look around while captured |
| W / A / S / D or arrow keys | Move with acceleration and deceleration |
| Press either Shift on land | Toggle the 4.3 m/s walk and 8.0 m/s run modes; a 1.4-second notice confirms the selection and it is saved across ordinary launches |
| Space / either Shift in water | Ascend / descend; both together hold depth. Diving movement is under development; underwater rendering/audio and runtime qualification remain unfinished. |
| F1 | Show or hide the developer diagnostics overlay |
| F2 | Toggle world-space shoreline/current, collision, terrain-contact, cell, wildlife navigation, bird route/spawn, and audio-zone/emitter diagnostics; visible only with F1 |
| F3 | In debug builds with F1 visible, toggle the bounded inspection camera; use WASD, Q/E, and Shift to fly |
| F4 | With F1 visible, copy the four authoritative procedural-layout seeds and show whether clipboard readback confirmed the copy |
| F11 | Toggle fullscreen on desktop/Web; browser permission or embedding policy may refuse it. Android keeps immersive mode. |
| Tab | Toggle player flight; WASD/arrows move horizontally, Space ascends and either Shift descends. Holding both vertical controls cancels vertical motion. Ceiling: 100 m above rendered terrain; radius: 330 m from island centre. Turning off selects safe dry ground nearby (grid fallback offshore). |
| F5 / F6 / F7 / F8 / F9 / F10 / J / K / L / O / F12 | With the overlay visible, teleport to QA locations; F9 faces the fish shallows, F10 the offshore shark, repeated J presses cycle through all seven monkeys, K cycles through six boars, L visits the cave entrance, O visits the campfire, and F12 enters the active offshore current for feedback QA |
| N | Open or close the discovery journal: the places and creatures found so far. A thing is written in when the walker comes near it and looks at it, with a short notice at the top; the journal is saved beside the settings. Android has a list button beside the sensitivity selector. |
| B | Smoothly disable or restore restrained walking/swimming camera motion; the selection is saved |
| M | Mute or unmute the ambient soundscape; the selection is saved |
| Escape | Release captured mouse; press again to exit |

Movement follows terrain, refuses uphill motion steeper than 38 degrees, and switches to swimming
in sufficiently deep water. Swimming is slower. An offshore current progressively resists outward
movement and carries the player back toward the island while adding a mild coast-parallel drift;
its inward component always dominates. A subtle peripheral tint and deeper
undertow texture strengthen with that same current field. Moving through shallow or swimming water
also produces subtle expanding surface ripples around the player. A moving water entry or exit
adds one stronger but short broken-ring burst; depth hysteresis and a cooldown keep small shoreline
corrections from retriggering it. On land, nearby mesh-grass tips
bend smoothly farther aside as walking speed rises and relax after the player stops.
Horizontal acceleration and braking have the same response in cardinal and diagonal directions,
so changing direction does not create a faster diagonal surge.
The keyboard mode notice is the only normal-play HUD text. It fades away completely, incurs no
normal steady-state draw, and does not appear for the Android stick's hold-style outer travel.
Walk/run selection, camera motion, audio mute, and touch-look sensitivity use the same schema-1
settings record. The game writes each accepted change immediately, keeps the last valid record as
a backup, and falls back to defaults or that backup with a diagnostic if the primary record is
missing or malformed. QA modes disable storage; `--no-user-settings` does so explicitly.

Jumping is intentionally absent. The game is not a platformer.

The developer overlay starts hidden during ordinary play. Launching with `--debug-overlay` enables
it immediately for captures and QA; `--world-debug` also enables its F2 world view. It reports
wall-clock frame timing, renderer/logical-viewport identity, player and ocean-current state, visible
terrain/vegetation cells, LOD populations, draw counts, and active audio sources against the
six-source ceiling. Its world-navigation line separately reports wildlife markers/targets/home
ranges and bird route-family/spawn/live-target counts. See `docs/debugging.md` for interpretation
and limitations.

The two `SEEDS` rows are always visible with the panel. F4 copies a stable English text block
containing the palm, grass, jungle, and natural-prop seeds. Desktop and Android expose a native
clipboard. Browser permission or user-gesture policy may reject the operation; in that case the
panel says `UNAVAILABLE` and the seed rows remain available for manual transcription.

The F3 camera is compiled into debug builds only. It starts at the rendered player-eye position,
keeps mouse look, moves at 12 m/s or 36 m/s with Shift, and is bounded to the island inspection
volume. Debug-camera Shift never changes the retained player walk/run selection. It freezes player movement and locomotion bob while wildlife visibility continues to use
the inspection camera. Press F3 again, or hide F1, to return exactly to the stationary player.

## Web (current)

The Web release build uses the same WASD/arrow movement, Shift run/walk toggle, mouse-look, F1,
F2, F4, B, M, and Escape controls. Browser security still requires a click before pointer lock. Its production page
displays click-to-play instructions and requests pointer lock directly from the first left-button
gesture, as required by browser security policy. The same gesture starts audio after browser
activation. Escape releases pointer lock without terminating the Web session; after the browser's
short security cooldown, clicking the canvas acquires it again. Automated Chromium/SwiftShader
coverage sends the actual Escape key and verifies unlock, continued frames, clean delayed
reacquisition, audio-mixer/track initialization,
correct screen-relative strafing, arrow parity, running, simultaneous movement/mouse look, focus,
an actual walking-to-swimming shoreline transition, and responsive 16:9 sizing. The narrower
Firefox ESR BiDi gate independently confirms trusted-click
pointer lock, forward movement, both persistent Shift edges, first-gesture audio initialization,
one land footstep, Escape release, delayed pointer-lock reacquisition, responsive 16:9 sizing, and
one actual second-tab activation with resumed animation/input, followed by dedicated fixed jungle/
water scenes after the production input session.
Normal Web launches persist the four preferences in CNA's origin-scoped IDBFS storage. The Chrome
gate changes camera motion, closes the first runtime, and requires a second runtime on the same
origin and browser profile to restore that setting.
Audible quality in a visible interactive browser remains to be checked manually.

## Android

The current Android build uses two simultaneous touch zones:

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| Touch and drag in the left half | Move with a floating analog stick anchored at the first contact |
| Touch and drag in the right half | Look relative to the preceding touch position |
| Tap the three-dot control at top right | Cycle standard, high, and low touch-look sensitivity |
| Release a contact | Stop the role owned by that pointer without disturbing the other role |

Subtle generated circles show the movement origin/thumb and the current look contact. The control
interpreter preserves pointer ownership if a finger crosses the screen centre, clamps movement to
a unit vector, applies a dead zone, and cancels missing contacts or contacts invalidated by a
display-size change. Non-finite or implausibly remote coordinates are treated as a missing contact,
invalid display geometry releases both roles, and relative-look output is bounded to one display
span per update. The next valid contact can immediately acquire the released role. The HUD remains
inside conservative display-edge margins. The sensitivity selector highlights its low, standard,
or high dot and applies a 0.72, 1.00, or 1.35 multiplier. Its contact cannot rotate the camera,
holding it cannot cycle repeatedly, and the selection survives resize and same-process pause/resume.
It is saved immediately and restored after a cold process restart together with keyboard
walk/run selection, camera motion, and audio mute.

Pushing the movement stick through 92 percent of its usable range selects the 8.0 m/s land pace;
easing it below 78 percent returns to walking. The gap prevents pace chatter near the threshold,
and the movement ring/thumb change from green to warm gold while touch running is selected.
Swimming keeps its independent 2.15 m/s pace. A run mode selected by a hardware Shift key remains
independent of the temporary touch-stick selection.

The implementation and deterministic multi-touch tests are complete, and the same HUD rendering
code runs on OpenGL 3.3, WebGL 2, and OpenGL ES 3. A KVM-accelerated API 35 emulator visibly
validated the translucent HUD and separately injected left-zone movement and right-zone look
gestures. The game also survived a same-process background/foreground cycle with its audio stream
paused and resumed, followed by a force-stop and qualified new-process GLES 3/audio launch.
The same accelerated run selected all three sensitivity levels and visually retained high across
Home/resume. A later persistence-qualified run selected high, then required a force-stopped new
process to reload high from the app-private settings container. Simultaneous real-finger feel,
optional handedness, long suspension, external audio
focus, and physical-device ergonomic tuning remain open.

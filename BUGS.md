# CNA and Sharp Runtime Issues Affecting island-simulator

This file is the authoritative record of confirmed or strongly evidenced framework defects that
materially affect `island-simulator`. CNA and Sharp Runtime are read-only dependencies. Framework
issues are worked around only inside this repository and are never patched in their worktrees.

The Android stock-skinned shader failure is confirmed and has an active game-side workaround.
The separate lifecycle issue remains suspected. Neither dependency has been modified by this project.

Consumer integration constraints, unsupported features, renderer limitations, and incorrect game
code do not belong here unless investigation demonstrates a framework defect. Suspected entries
must say `Status: Suspected` and must not present a guessed cause as fact.

## CNA status audit — 2026-11-03

**Not all development findings are fixed in current CNA.** This repository records two framework
issues: one confirmed shader defect and one suspected Android lifecycle defect. The confirmed
shader failure mechanism is still present; the lifecycle issue has no verified closure.

Audited source snapshots:

- Published CNA `next`: [`611825cf2728`](https://github.com/libcna/cna/commit/611825cf2728d75511fd4d9cd288370d8b970190),
  verified through GitHub on 2026-11-03.
- Local CNA `next`: `3be0756e131afb2d1f494d406fe1e70fcf5f8d52`, inspected at 16:53 UTC.
  The checkout also contains unrelated uncommitted work; the audited files match this commit.
  Local commits ahead of the published branch are not represented as published fixes.
  A subsequent check at `e28441da07e9cae80d4f513ec3d8920fa0854cd3` found no intervening
  changes to the audited renderer, lifecycle implementation or lifecycle test.
- The game still builds its locked CNA `97783d1e090c6d84f4b6a6d7746516e65184569e` export.
  An upstream source change would not automatically update this application's binary.

| Finding | Current disposition | Required before closure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CNA-ISLAND-001: Android surface destruction/Home-resume | **Suspected, open; fix not verified.** The lifecycle queue, mobile suspension loop and context-loss guards exist, but do not establish recovery from the recorded asynchronous surface/presentation failure. | Qualify the actual Android surface-loss/resume case on a deliberately updated dependency build; preserve the failed historical evidence. |
| CNA-ISLAND-002: stock skinning exceeds the tested uniform limit, then continues after link failure | **Confirmed; source mechanism persists; game workaround active.** Stock vertex-lit skinning still declares 72 `mat4` bones; the compiler helper still logs failures without aborting initialization. | Respect the target's shader limits while retaining XNA's 72-bone public contract, stop initialization after compiler/link failure, and verify actual stock rendering on the affected GLES configuration. |
| AMDGPU GPUVM/session loss and flight instability | **Open, separate driver/hardware investigation.** Neither incident has been attributed to a confirmed CNA defect. | Follow the incident's approved qualification procedure; successful software rendering does not close it. |

This audit checks source, history, existing tests and the documented reproductions. It does not
claim a fresh Android runtime test or physical-GPU qualification, and does not change dependency
pins or remove the monkey workaround. Machine-readable source identities are retained in
`build/cna-issue-audit-20261103.json`. Consumer camera/clip-depth defects, capture-supervisor bugs,
and the rapid-transition audio-log observation are not added as confirmed CNA bugs.

### CNA-ISLAND-001 — Android presentation races surface destruction during Home/resume

**Component:** CNA SDL3 platform/runtime presentation boundary

**Branch/revision:** next, `97783d1e090c6d84f4b6a6d7746516e65184569e`

**Platform/renderer:** Android API 35 x86_64 emulator, GLES3 on SwiftShader

**Severity:** High

**Status:** Suspected; observed lifecycle failure, exact ownership/root cause unconfirmed

**Last reviewed:** 2026-11-03; current CNA source inspected, no verified fix

**Date discovered:** 2026-10-11

#### Symptoms and evidence

Contained run `build/android-software/20261011T073115.062445Z-interactive` passes touch
selection, land footsteps and shoreline traversal, then fails same-process Home/resume.
`game-workload.log` records `surfaceDestroyed()` / `nativePause()` at 09:32:28.542,
`eglSwapBuffersWithDamageKHRImpl` returning `EGL_BAD_SURFACE` at 09:32:29.258 and
`CNA::Platform: GlContext::SwapBuffers failed` terminating the game at 09:32:29.913.
The Java surface is recreated in between, at 09:32:29.385. Kernel delta is empty and the
owned emulator exits zero. This is not an AMD GPU fault. An earlier lifecycle run on the
footpath tree (`20261011T071027.731091Z-interactive`) passed; timing dependence is plausible.

#### Reproduction

Use the contained launcher with the x86_64 ridge-stage APK, `--viewpoint interactive
--touch-selector --lifecycle --traversal`; see `docs/ridge-and-valleys.md`. A single failed
run establishes the failure, not deterministic reproduction. Retain its evidence even if
a subsequent attempt passes.

Identical-APK repeat `20261011T073355.598497Z-interactive` passes every gate, including
hot resume (PID 1756) and cold relaunch (PID 3258). This demonstrates intermittent behaviour
on the same artifact; it does not resolve the failure or qualify reliable Android lifecycle.

#### Suspected cause and consumer impact

Read-only source inspection: `Sdl3Platform::LifecycleWatch` queues lifecycle events for a
later poll; `Game` calls `Draw` then `EndDraw`; `GraphicsDeviceManager::EndDraw` presents
and rethrows failures; `Sdl3GlContext::SwapBuffers` throws on a failed SDL swap. A surface
loss during a long software-rendered frame may reach presentation before lifecycle handling
can defer drawing. The SDL/EGL surface ownership sequence needs upstream investigation;
no claim is made that the terrain shader itself causes the race.

Android lifecycle qualification remains degraded until resolved. The game must survive
surface destruction/recreation during backgrounding rather than exit with a fatal error.
There is no consumer workaround: swallowing presentation exceptions or delaying the Home
test would hide the defect. Dependencies remain untouched; nothing has been reported externally.

#### Additional lifecycle qualification observation (not proven to share this cause)

Coast-stage run `20261011T075739.370693Z-interactive` restores the same PID 1869, surface,
window dimensions and focus, and continues rendering without the fatal `EGL_BAD_SURFACE`.
It still fails the lifecycle gate because neither `AAudioStream_requestPause` nor
`AAudioStream_requestStart` appears in the hot-resume log. Surface destruction/nativePause
occur at 09:59:54.097 / 09:59:54.221, nativeResume at 09:59:55.476. The short background
interval and queued lifecycle handling merit investigation, but missing log evidence alone
does not prove an audio engine defect or establish the same root cause as the earlier crash.
Kernel delta is empty. The prior generic failure message incorrectly suggested that surface
or focus failed; the harness now identifies the process/surface/focus/audio gate and prints
audio qualification and both PIDs. No acceptance condition was removed.

Read-only follow-up identifies a concrete mechanism: bundled SDL's
`third_party/SDL/src/core/android/SDL_android.c`, `Android_SendLifecycleEvent`, removes a
pending PAUSE when RESUME arrives before the event pump consumes it (and vice versa).
`SDL_androidevents.c` calls `Android_PauseAudio` only from the consumed pause handler;
`Android_ResumeAudio` acts only if audio was paused. Therefore a short Home/resume can
legitimately produce Java surface/focus logs without AAudio pause/start calls. This code
path is verified; its execution in the failed run is not instrumented and remains an inference.
The audio assertion currently combines a fixed two-second background interval with a demand
for completed suspension. A future suspension-specific test should await observable pause
before requesting resume, with a bounded deadline; retain a separate rapid-transition stress
case and do not weaken the fatal-swap/surface checks. Missing audio log calls alone must not
be promoted to a confirmed framework defect.

#### 2026-11-03 source review

The published and local snapshots above still queue translated events in
[`Sdl3Platform::LifecycleWatch`](https://github.com/libcna/cna/blob/611825cf2728d75511fd4d9cd288370d8b970190/modules/platform/src/Sdl3/Sdl3Platform.cpp#L545).
`Game` processes them during polling; its mobile run loop waits once suspension is observed.
That suspension mechanism already exists in the game's locked CNA revision, so its presence
today is not evidence of a new fix. Current EasyGL also refuses drawing/presentation when
MetaGL reports a lost context, but an Android surface becoming invalid is not proven to be
reported through that guard before the recorded failed swap. The
[`SDL3 swap service`](https://github.com/libcna/cna/blob/611825cf2728d75511fd4d9cd288370d8b970190/modules/platform/src/Sdl3/Sdl3GraphicsServices.cpp#L177)
still throws on a failed swap, and `GraphicsDeviceManager::EndDraw` rethrows presentation failures.

The current `GameTest.MobileLifecycleEventsSuspendResumeAndTerminateTheLoop` checks scripted
lifecycle events and suspension state. It does not reproduce asynchronous Android surface loss
during a draw. No new Android run was performed for this audit; neither a current reproduction
nor a reliable fix is claimed. The original suspected attribution remains unchanged.

### CNA-ISLAND-002 — Android guest uniform queries report invalid operation at first draw

**Component:** CNA EasyGL stock-program initialization / Android guest graphics boundary

**Branch/revision:** CNA next `97783d1e090c6d84f4b6a6d7746516e65184569e`,
EasyGL `f4d6afaf16cdc7e7e73130950bc45e6d865b41bd`

**Platform/renderer:** Android API 35 x86_64 emulator, GLES3 on SwiftShader

**Severity:** High; stock-skinned monkeys are absent in the Android close view

**Status:** Confirmed on the tested Android emulator; game workaround active; source mechanism persists upstream

**Last reviewed:** 2026-11-03; published and local CNA `next` inspected

**Date discovered:** 2026-10-11

#### Evidence and scope

Run `20261011T095903.886091Z-litter` logs 27 identical gfxstream guest
`GL2Encoder.cpp:s_glGetUniformLocation` errors `0x502` at 12:00:14.754, immediately
before the first-draw report. Its image is complete and the existing startup/image gates
pass; those gates do not reject every guest GL diagnostic. These facts do not prove all
draws succeeded. Host kernel delta is empty; this is not a host AMD GPU fault.
The same 27 messages appear in pre-normal-fix `20261011T092539.275219Z-interactive`.
Same-APK `20261011T100107.688712Z-wet-sand` has no `GL error` matches.
Retain all logs; do not describe the litter result as a zero-error graphics qualification.

#### Initial source hypothesis — superseded by confirming evidence below

In the pinned CNA export, `modules/renderers/easygl/src/EasyGLRenderer.cpp`,
`CompileAndLink` (around line 9141) prints shader/link failures to `std::cerr` but does
not abort or return failure. Stock initialization then queries uniform locations and sets
`ready = true` without checking link success. EasyGL `src/Program.cpp::uniform_location`
checks creation, not link status, before forwarding to MetaGL.

One candidate is `EnsureSkinnedVertexLitProgram`: it performs 24 direct location queries
plus three in `ResolveRenderTargetOrientationUniforms`, matching the observed count of 27.
The monkey renderer uses stock `SkinnedEffect` without overriding its default vertex-lit
selection. A failed stock-program link could therefore produce this burst. This is an
inference, not attribution: the count is not a program identifier, and that initial logcat
does not contain a corresponding compiler/linker message. At this point no uniform-limit or
driver defect had been established; the confirming diagnostic run is recorded next.

#### Confirming runtime evidence

The hypothesis above was confirmed by diagnostic build `1a1bf75`: game-owned bounded
stderr mirroring exposes the previously hidden link log, without modifying dependencies.
Contained monkey run `20261011T101527.286817Z-monkeys` reports at 12:16:35.328:

```text
[CNA EasyGL 3D] skinned (vertex-lit) link failed:
Vertex shader active uniforms exceed GL_MAX_VERTEX_UNIFORM_VECTORS (256)
```

The next lines are the same 27 uniform-query errors. The inspected monkey close screenshot
contains terrain/vegetation and touch controls but no monkeys. The stock shader declares
`mat4 uBones[72]`, in addition to its other uniforms; the game uses a 14-bone rig. This is
a demonstrated stock-program compatibility/failure-handling defect on this renderer, not
evidence of an emulator driver bug. Host kernel delta is empty.

Subsequent native investigation also finds an empty close view with both a draft 14-bone
replacement and the original stock program on llvmpipe. Thus the Android link failure is
confirmed, but is not established as the ONLY reason for absent monkey pixels in the current
scene. Follow-up resolved two consumer issues: the QA camera lost the moving close subject,
and the draft shader omitted GL clip-depth conversion. Native close geometry is now visible;
see `docs/monkey-palette-workaround.md`. Neither issue invalidates the Android link failure.

The old harness still reports `passed` for this run: preserve that historical JSON unchanged
as evidence of a false positive, NOT graphics acceptance. The harness now explicitly rejects
stock VS/FS/link failures and nonzero guest GL errors at initial, post-traversal, hot-resume
and cold-relaunch gates. Device-free fixtures cover these failures and benign log lines.
Diagnostic x86 APK is retained as `build/android-software/island-diagnostic-x86_64.apk`,
20,447,851 bytes, SHA-256
`c88063a1c1a0950c18f2fd0a9abc1ef5cc2bb6eddb7685dd58f6f770ed715128`.

#### Game-side mitigation and qualification

A consumer-owned shader with the actual 14-bone palette is implemented as the workaround;
it must preserve rig animation, lighting, canopy transmission, colour/texture and fog rather
than hiding monkeys or forcing a different scene. Native and Android close captures plus
Web before/after-simulation images pass and are inspected, with no shader/GL diagnostics;
see the workaround document for exact artifacts. Continuous motion-quality, full browser
input/lifecycle and physical ARM64 checks are not implied by these bounded captures.
Do not claim older generic image/startup gates established monkey visibility. Dependencies
remain read-only; nothing has been submitted externally. Android lifecycle is a separate issue.

#### 2026-11-03 source review and workaround status

[`GlStockShaderSources::SkinnedVertexLitSource`](https://github.com/libcna/cna/blob/611825cf2728d75511fd4d9cd288370d8b970190/modules/renderers/easygl/include/CNA/Internal/Renderers/EasyGL/GlStockShaderSources.hpp#L1197)
still declares 72 `mat4` bone uniforms: 288 vertex-uniform vectors before the other uniforms,
already beyond the affected emulator's reported 256-vector limit. Uploading only the game's
14 bone transforms does not reduce the shader's declared, dynamically indexed palette.
XNA's public `SkinnedEffect::MaxBones == 72` is intentional compatibility, not itself the bug.
The missing resource-limit handling must be addressed without reducing that public contract.

[`CompileAndLink`](https://github.com/libcna/cna/blob/611825cf2728d75511fd4d9cd288370d8b970190/modules/renderers/easygl/src/EasyGLRenderer.cpp#L9116)
still logs vertex/fragment/link failures and returns normally. `EnsureSkinnedVertexLitProgram`
then queries uniforms and sets `ready = true`. The inspected sibling EasyGL `develop`
`b582bd85f646678d1de38473160defed4729f323` still checks only program creation in
`Program::uniform_location`, not successful linking. No source-level fix for this mechanism
was found in either audited CNA snapshot. This is source evidence, not a new Android execution.

The game-side GLSL 330/ES 300 path is active in `MonkeyRenderer.cpp` and
`MonkeySkinningShader.hpp`; it uses 14 skeleton matrices plus four sole matrices, with a
conservative 92-vector vertex budget. See [workaround evidence](docs/monkey-palette-workaround.md).
The former status saying no workaround existed was stale. Existing API/source-contract tests
that preserve 72 bones do not establish compatibility with the affected GLES uniform limit.
Keep the workaround until a deliberately updated dependency build passes stock-shader link,
error handling, visible monkey geometry and relevant animation checks on that configuration.
